 # Instructions: How to [Split BCH and BCHA](https://splitbch.org/)
1. Create a new wallet in the "Wallet" tab, copy the address and send all of your BCH to yourself. Wait 6 confirmations and Check your BCH - BCHA balance. This means your coins are split. Now you are ready to access your BCHA.

2. Just import your Bitcoin Cash wallet and the split will be done automatically.

In order to use this tool, you must have a paper wallet (or private key) holding BCH. This tool will help you split your BCH and BCHA coins.

### Benefits of the new release
Faster confirmations
Slow confirmations have been an ongoing frustration for Bitcoin Cash users and businesses alike. A new difficulty adjustment algorithm called ASERT helps by reducing the incidence of unexpectedly long block times. As a result, transactions will be confirmed more quickly on average.

### More predictable profits
Previously, businesses consistently mining Bitcoin Cash were prone to occasional profit loss because the difficulty adjustment algorithm was flawed. With ASERT, steady miners will see more stable profits and can earn up to 6% more, according to simulations.

### Reliable network development
A new coinbase rule will reinvest 8% of the coinbase reward into Bitcoin Cash infrastructure development. That means more technical talent can be hired to maintain and develop the network so it can better support your business moving forward.
